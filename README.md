# GitHub Actions on RISC-V

The repository contains a podman Dockerfile which can set up github actions package on RISC-V for setting up the RISC-V machine as a GitHub runner for CI/CD. The setup is being tested on Milk-V Pioneer Box.

It uses https://github.com/dkurt/github_actions_riscv as the GitHub actions for RISC-V (for now).
